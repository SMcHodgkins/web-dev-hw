# Questions
**1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?**

I learned quite a bit in this section and I appreciate the repetition and layering of html elements upon one another each week. I struggled a bit with the forms and probably made a mistake or two that week. This week really starting to utilize the style head element made me realize that if you improperly tag your elements you could potentially earn yourself a ton more work troubleshooting.

**2. Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?**

I'm excited to learn about how to properly build a website so it doesn't look quite as bad. That might just be a me problem but if I still get skills along the way I'm still in for the ride.
