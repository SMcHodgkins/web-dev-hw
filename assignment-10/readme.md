1. I tried to find a decorative font for the heading and first letters, something ancient feeling. I selected a simple, easy to read font for the body. These two in conjunction add flavor to the piece.

2. System fonts are those installed locally to be used by programs. Web fonts are hosted on a server and are called to use. Web-Safe fonts are available locally across separate OS. When the font a developer selected is unavailable a series of fallback fonts will be loaded in succession. Selecting similar fonts allows for design integrity to be maintained and gives the browser fallback options from the stack.

3. **Work Cycle**
 - built base html file
 - Built header and styled
 - Filled in body text
 - Added some margins
 - Added one font style
 - Well, that's not legible
 - Picked another font
 - Better, but had to remove underline
 - Added second font
 - Adjusted the line-height
 - Added pseudo-elements to the first letter of paragraphs
 - Changed link properties
 - had one too many <! at the start of the doc, fixed, pushed

 - Something is amiss, going to try linking
 - Linking appears to be working
