<hr />
  <p> Born June 15, 1763, Kobayashi Nobuyuki was not much of a poet, because he was a baby. But that would soon change due to tramatic life experiences like his mother dying and his father remarrying. This remarry wasn't such a big deal because he was primarily taken care of by his grandmother until he was 14 when she died too. Deciding he was fed up with his father, step-mother, and step-brother he left home to study haiku. Cut forward 35 years and he gets married. Things were looking up until his two children died. At some point he took on the moniker "Issa" because it was more poetic.  </p>

  <p> Oh, and he wrote <a href="./index.html">poetry</a> too.</p>
