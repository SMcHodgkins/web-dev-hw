1. Selectors
 * The universal selector applies to all elements on a page.

 * An element selector applies to specific targeted elements. Headings for example.
 * A class selector uses the class attributed to an element to style it.

 * An ID selector uses the established ID associated with an element to style.

 * Universal selector would be useful for applying a consistent style, Element for differentiating reused elements across the page, and class/ID for fine tuning specific style cases.

2. I decided to go with an 80s themed color palette cyan and magenta as main colors with a supporting desaturated green.
 * C1=2BD1FC
 * C2=E84DA3
 * C3=C0FFDA


3. **Work Summary**
 * Set up my index
 * Added the link to my CSS file
 * Added some test text and pushed live
 * Style was not applied, more testing needed
 * Didn't properly link it
 * Experimented with styles
 * Class selector didn't work
 * The issue appears to be with cascading rules
