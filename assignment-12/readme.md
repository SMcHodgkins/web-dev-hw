1. My imaginary client was an octopus starting a podcast to teach people about cephalopods and help them learn to accept the cepheriority. They wanted a calming water theme for colors

2. Display: Inline elements take up horizontal space and disregards width properties. Inline-block works like inline but still functions inside of a parent container and needs width set. The block element takes inline elements and forces them to be block level.

3. **Work cycle**
 - Started by creating all my base documents
 - Tested out some early links between documents
 - Started building dropdown/main menu
 - Got the basic dropdown working
 - Applied it across documents
 - Added placeholder text and images
 - Found some fonts
 - Added a font CSS file
 - Struggled with getting images to scale properly with different zooms
 - Finally got that working by applying the class to the img itself
 - Pretty much done
