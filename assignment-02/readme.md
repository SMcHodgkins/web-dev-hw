# Assignment 2
## Scott McHodgkins

I decided to take this class because web design always seemed to be this monolithic topic that I would dip my toes into but never actually commit to learning. As users we only seem to notice design when it doesn't work. This speaks to the amount of work goes into most web designs when they work exactly as we think they should without resistance. I'd like to improve my design sensiblities and begin to think more about how design influences user behavior.

### **List of things I hope I learn**
1. How to better format text for readability
2. Whether I enjoy web design or not
    - (Enjoying it so far)
3. To better appreciate good web design
