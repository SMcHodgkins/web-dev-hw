##Questions

1. I basically knew nothing going into this course about anything webdev related. So getting a crash course on pushing builds live and using version control was neat.

2. My only other experience with web design was making my myspace profile look sick when I was a teen and that information faded quick. I learned quite a bit in this class about designing a website and incorporating appropriate elements. I know I've only scratched the surface, so I look forawrd to learning more.

3. **Work Cycle**
 - With free rein to do whatever I want I find it difficult to actually pick something worth creating
 - Guess I'll make a basic gallery page
 - Started by adding the basic elements to my pages
 - Doodled what I wanted it to look like
 - Formatted my images
 - Started building my header
 - Added logo
 - added a home image
 - trying to get my footer to stay still
 - Got it to stay put, started building my links
 - Realized I could of made my header much easier if it built a specific container for it.
 - Oh well, back to navbar links
 - Got the navbar formatted and stable
 - Footer is broken on other pages, gonna table it for now
 - Added main content container for Art
 - Added all art in
 - made a top button
 - Added a shadow to my active links
 - Realized I didn't plan for additional media
 - Added media to my about page
 - Added in a contact formatted
 - Applied some fonts
 - Calling it a display
 - Realized I didn't have a dropdown menu, I should really read the guidelines first
 - That's not going to happen. I'll take the hit to my grade.
